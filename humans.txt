Project: Sandgraal’s Retro Game List

/* ABOUT */
Lifelong retro gamer, and builder of tools for peoples.
Believes in local-first, privacy-respecting software and actually finishing the backlog.
Fan of hand-crafted hot sauce, open source, and finding the perfect “deep cut” game for every mood.

/* SITE */
Built with: HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
Philosophy: Simple, fast.
Features: Game search/filter, local collection tracking, share codes, and direct gameplay resources.
Design: Old-school pixel flavor with a modern, mobile-friendly UI.

/* THANKS */
Thanks to:
- Everyone building the open web and keeping retro gaming accessible
- All the CSV/table JS demo coders out there
- The classic game devs who made all this possible (and the ROM dumpers who kept it alive)

/* WHY */
Built to keep my ROM collection organized, accessible, and private—without resorting to SaaS or cloud logins.
If it’s useful for you, fork it, improve it, or just play more games.
