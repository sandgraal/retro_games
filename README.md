# Sandgraal's Retro Game List

WIP: A fast, private, and no-nonsense tracker for classic and retro games.

**Features:**
- Instantly search, sort, and filter a growing database of console classics
- Mark games as “owned” (stored locally in your browser for privacy)
- Share your collection with anyone via code—no registration required
- See box art, details, and direct links to gameplay videos or GameFAQs
- Fully mobile and desktop compatible

This is not another bloated ROM launcher or subscription service.  
It’s a clean, modern tool for serious collectors, archivists, and retro fans who want control over their library.
