## Collecting Strategies

### Starting Your Collection

**Budget-Friendly Entry Points ($20-50 each):**

- Sonic the Hedgehog 1/2 (Genesis)
- Super Mario Bros. series (NES)
- Crash Bandicoot trilogy (PS1)
- Vectorman 1/2 (Genesis)

- Mega Man X (SNES)
- Banjo-Kazooie (N64)

### What to Look For

**Condition Priorities:**

1. **Cart/Disc condition** - Clean, working, minimal label damage
2. **Manual** - Adds significant value, especially for RPG-adjacent titles
3. **Box** - CIB commands 2-3x loose prices for popular titles
4. **Inserts** - Registration cards, posters less critical but nice

**Common Issues:**

- NES cart pins (can be cleaned)
- SNES yellowing (sun damage)
- Genesis cart label peeling
- PS1 disc scratches (affects loading)
- GBA label wear from pocket carry

### Regional Variants

**Japanese Imports Worth Considering:**

- Generally cheaper for common titles
- Mega Man = "Rockman" (often cooler box art)
- Some games never localized (Pulseman)
- Language barrier varies by game

**PAL Considerations:**

- 50Hz vs 60Hz speed differences
- Different box sizes (good for display)
- Some exclusive titles

## Price Trends & Market Analysis

### Current Market (December 2025)

**Stable Categories:**

- Common NES/SNES Nintendo first-party titles
- Genesis Sonic games
- PS1 Crash/Spyro series

**Rising Values:**

- Late-era GBA titles (especially Castlevania, Mega Man Zero)
- Quality action-platformers (Gunstar Heroes, Contra series)
- Sealed copies of popular titles
- CIB copies of previously loose-only collections

**Declining Trends:**

- Oversaturated common titles
- Sports-adjacent platformers
- Licensed games (most)

### Investment Considerations

**Hold Long-Term:**

- CIB Nintendo first-party
- Rare Capcom/Konami titles
- High-quality Treasure games
- Complete GBA collections

**Trade/Upgrade Priority:**

- Loose commons when upgrading to CIB
- Duplicate copies
- Games you won't replay

## Red Flags & Authentication

### Reproduction Detection

**NES/SNES:**

- Check board inside (security bit required)
- Label quality and font
- Cart shell color and texture
- Weight comparison

**Genesis:**

- Board inspection
- Label font and printing quality
- Cart notches and size

**GBA:**

- Nintendo logo stamping
