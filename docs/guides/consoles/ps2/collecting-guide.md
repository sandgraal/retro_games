# Collecting for PlayStation 2: The Complete Guide

_Last updated: January 2025_

## Introduction

The PlayStation 2 remains the best-selling home console of all time, with over 155 million units sold worldwide. Its massive library of over 4,000 games makes it both an accessible entry point for new collectors and a deep rabbit hole for completionists.

**Why collect for PS2?**

- Enormous library spanning every genre imaginable
- Generally affordable entry point (though rare titles are rising)
- Strong nostalgia factor for millennials and Gen-Z
- Backward compatible with PS1 games
- Still has an active community and modding scene

### Storage & Preservation
