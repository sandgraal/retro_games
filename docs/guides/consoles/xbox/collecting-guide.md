# Collecting for Xbox: The Complete Guide

_Last updated: December 2025_

## Introduction

Microsoft's entry into the console market was bold and ambitious. The original Xbox brought PC-level hardware to the living room, pioneered online console gaming with Xbox Live, and introduced franchises that would define a generation. For collectors, the Xbox offers excellent value with a deep library that's often overlooked compared to its competitors.

**Why Collect for Xbox?**

- Affordable entry point compared to PS2 or GameCube
- Powerful hardware means many games still look great
- Best versions of many multiplatform titles
- Excellent exclusives from Western developers
- Active modding and preservation community
- Built-in hard drive enabled unique gaming experiences

**Current Market Position:** The original Xbox remains undervalued. Most common games are $5-15, with even popular titles rarely exceeding $40-50. This represents excellent value for quality.
