# Collecting for PlayStation 3: The Complete Guide

_Last updated: December 2025_

## Introduction

The PlayStation 3 had a rocky start - expensive launch, difficult development, and early exclusives going multiplatform. But by the end of its life, the PS3 had assembled one of gaming's most impressive exclusive libraries, pioneered free online play, and delivered experiences impossible elsewhere.

**Why Collect for PS3?**

- Unparalleled exclusive library (Uncharted, Last of Us, God of War III)
- Free online play (still active for some games)
- Blu-ray player built-in
- Full PS1 backward compatibility
- Select models play PS2 discs
- Many games remained exclusive (no PC ports)
- Currently undervalued market

**Current Market Position:** PS3 collecting is emerging. Common games are extremely cheap ($3-10), while rare titles and special editions are climbing. The 7th generation is about to enter its collecting prime.

## Console Buying Guide

### Which Model to Buy?

| Model       | PS2 Compat | Size    | Reliability | Price    | Best For               |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Fat (Early) | **Yes**    | Large   | Lowest      | $100-200 | PS1/PS2/PS3 all-in-one |
| Fat (Later) | No         | Large   | Low-Medium  | $60-100  | Budget + media         |
| **Slim**    | **No**     | **Med** | **High**    | $70-120  | **Best overall**       |
| Super Slim  | No         | Small   | High        | $60-100  | Space-saving           |

**Recommendation:** The Slim (CECH-25xx or later) offers the best reliability. Get a PS2-compatible Fat ONLY if you need PS2 discs - they're prone to YLOD.

### PS2 Backward Compatible Models

These models play PS2 discs:

| Model   | Region | PS2 Support        | Rarity    |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------ | --------- |
| CECHA01 | NA     | Full (Hardware)    | Rare      |
| CECHB01 | NA     | Full (Hardware)    | Very Rare |
| CECHC0x | EU     | Partial (Software) | Uncommon  |
| CECHE0x | NA     | Partial (Software) | Uncommon  |

**Warning:** PS2-compatible models have higher failure rates due to additional chips generating heat.

### Hardware Condition Checklist

| Component     | What to Check                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |

| USB ports     | All functional                         |
| Fan noise     | Shouldn't sound like jet engine        |
| Controller    | Responsive, charges properly           |
| Hard drive    | Check capacity, test with game install |
| Thermal paste | Age indicator - may need replacement   |
