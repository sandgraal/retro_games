# Collecting for Nintendo 64: The Complete Guide

_Last updated: December 2025_

## Introduction

The Nintendo 64 represents a pivotal moment in gaming history—Nintendo's bold leap into 3D gaming with a cartridge-based system in an era dominated by CD-ROMs. While the PS1 outsold it significantly, the N64 cultivated one of the most beloved libraries in gaming history, with titles that defined multiplayer gaming for a generation.

For collectors, the N64 offers a sweet spot: a manageable library of 388 North American releases (vs. thousands for PS1/PS2), generally excellent cartridge durability, and some of the most iconic games ever made. The system's emphasis on local multiplayer means many cartridges saw heavy use, making minty copies more valuable.

**Current Market Position**: Mid-tier entry point. Common games remain affordable ($10-30), but first-party Nintendo titles and RPGs have seen significant appreciation since 2020.

## Collecting Tips

### What to Look For

**Complete in Box (CIB) Requirements:**

- Original cardboard box (most valuable component—fragile!)
- Game cartridge with original label
- Instruction manual (booklet)
- Cardboard inserts/trays
- Consumer information/warranty cards
- Registration cards (minor value add)

**Cartridge Condition Grading:**

| Grade | Label           | Cart Shell      | Contacts      | Value |
| ----- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Mint  | Perfect         | No wear         | Like new      | 100%  |
| NM    | Minor edge wear | Light scuffs    | Clean         | 80%   |
| VG    | Some wear       | Moderate scuffs | Some tarnish  | 60%   |
| Good  | Visible wear    | Yellowing/marks | Works fine    | 40%   |
| Fair  | Major damage    | Heavy wear      | Cleaned often | 20%   |

**Box Condition Notes:**

- Cardboard boxes are the most fragile component
- Crushing, tears, and price sticker damage are common
- Box protectors are essential for storage
- Hanging tab intact adds value
- Original shrink wrap (sealed) = significant premium

### Red Flags

**Reproduction Carts:**

- Weight feels different (lighter often = repro)
- Label quality off (colors too saturated, wrong fonts)
- Back label font inconsistent
- Screw heads wrong shape (repros often use Phillips)
- Board inside doesn't match Nintendo specs

**Common Fakes:**

- Harvest Moon 64 (high value target)
- Conker's Bad Fur Day
- Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut (almost all "finds" are fake)
- Japanese imports relabeled as NTSC

**Reproduction Boxes:**

- Paper weight/thickness differs
- Colors slightly off
- Missing embossing or security features
- Too crisp/clean for age
- UPC code differences

### Storage & Preservation

**Cartridge Care:**

- Store upright in plastic protectors
- Avoid temperature/humidity extremes
- Clean contacts with 90%+ isopropyl alcohol
- Never use erasers on contacts (removes gold plating)
- Keep away from magnets (not typically an issue for N64, but good practice)

**Box Preservation:**

- Box protectors are mandatory (0.5mm PET recommended)
- Store flat or carefully supported upright
- Avoid direct sunlight (fades cardboard)
- Control humidity (prevents warping)
- Remove price stickers carefully with heat gun

**Controller Storage:**

- Original sticks wear out quickly (common issue)
- Store without tension on stick
- Consider replacement sticks for players
- Keep original sticks for collectors
