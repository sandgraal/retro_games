# Collecting for Nintendo DS: The Complete Guide

_Last updated: December 2025_

## Introduction

The Nintendo DS revolutionized portable gaming with its dual screens and touch interface. With over 154 million units sold, it's one of the most successful gaming platforms ever. The library spans thousands of games, from innovative touch-based experiences to traditional RPGs that pushed the hardware to its limits.

**Why Collect for DS?**

- Massive library with something for everyone
- Innovative games that used dual screens creatively
- Pokemon, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy at their portable best
- Touch-based gameplay unique to the platform
- Backwards compatible with GBA (DS/DS Lite)
- Relatively affordable entry point

**Current Market Position:** DS collecting is entering its prime. Common games are affordable, but Pokemon and quality RPGs command strong prices. Sealed and CIB items are increasingly valuable.
