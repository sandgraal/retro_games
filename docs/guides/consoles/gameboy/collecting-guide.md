- Any valuable game

**Visual Inspection:**

3. **Screw Type**: Authentic games use gamebit screws (not Phillips)
4. **ESRB Rating**: Era-appropriate rating box position and style
5. **Font/Text**: Compare to known authentic examples

**Physical Inspection:**

1. **Weight**: Bootlegs often feel lighter
2. **Cartridge Pins**: Authentic pins are gold-plated, clean
3. **Internal PCB**: Compare to online references
4. **Chip Markings**: Should match known authentic boards

### Opening Cartridges Safely

**Tools Needed:**

- 3.8mm gamebit screwdriver (GB/GBC)
- Tri-wing screwdriver (GBA)

**Inspection Points:**

- Chip placement and labeling
- PCB quality (green solder mask, clean traces)
