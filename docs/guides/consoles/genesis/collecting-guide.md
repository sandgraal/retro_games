- Color saturation off
- Missing embossed elements
- Barcode placement errors

**Board Inspection:**

- Open cartridge with 3.8mm gamebit
- Authentic boards have Sega markings
- Check ROM chip labeling
- Look for cheap EPROM chips (indicate repro)

### High-Risk Titles (Frequently Reproduced)

- M.U.S.H.A.
- Crusader of Centy
- Mega Turrican
- Thunder Force IV
- Phantasy Star IV
- Gley Lancer
- Monster World IV
- Contra: Hard Corps

**Authentication Tips:**

1. Buy from reputable sellers with return policies
2. Request board photos before purchasing expensive games
