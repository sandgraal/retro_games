# Collecting for Super Nintendo: The Complete Guide

_Last updated: January 2025_

## Introduction

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) represents the golden age of 16-bit gaming. Released in 1991 in North America, the SNES built upon the NES legacy with enhanced graphics, iconic sound chips, and one of the greatest game libraries ever assembled.

**Why collect for SNES?**

- Arguably the greatest library of 16-bit games
- Iconic franchises at their peak (Zelda, Mario, Metroid, Final Fantasy)
- Premium collectible status with strong value retention
- Robust cartridge format with excellent longevity
- Active ROM hacking and homebrew community

## Console Variants

### Regional Variants

| Region                 | Model Name     | Design                  | Notable Differences                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| NTSC-U (North America) | Super Nintendo | Purple/gray boxy design | 60Hz, largest English library                  |
| PAL (Europe/Australia) | Super Nintendo | Same as NA              | 50Hz, some exclusive titles, slower gameplay   |
| NTSC-J (Japan)         | Super Famicom  | Curved colorful design  | 60Hz, largest overall library, many exclusives |

### Hardware Revisions

- **SNS-001**: Original model, best picture quality with RGB
- **SNS-101 (SNES Jr/Mini)**: Redesigned compact model, lower cost, reduced features
- **Super Famicom Jr**: Japan-only compact model

**Collector's Note**: The original SNS-001 is preferred for video quality; the SNES Jr is more affordable but lacks some A/V options.

## Collecting Tips

### What to Look For

**Complete in Box (CIB) Requirements:**

- Original cardboard box (most fragile component)
- Cartridge with end label
- Manual (essential for RPGs)
- Inserts, posters, registration cards (for purists)
- Plastic tray (often missing)

**Cartridge Condition:**

- Check label condition (fading, tears, stickers)
- Test all games if possible
- Look for battery-backed saves (may need replacement)
- Check pins for corrosion or cleaning damage

**Box Condition:**

- Cardboard boxes are fragile - crush damage is common
- Check for price stickers and removal damage
- Flap integrity is important
- Original shrinkwrap is extremely rare

### Red Flags

**Reproduction & Counterfeit Signs:**

- Wrong color plastic on cartridge
- Poor label print quality
- Incorrect font on Nintendo Seal
- Light weight (should feel solid)
- Common fakes: EarthBound, Chrono Trigger, Harvest Moon

**Common Fakes:**

- Reproduction labels on authentic carts
- Complete reproduction boxes (increasingly common)
- Reproduction manuals (paper quality is key)

### Storage & Preservation

- Store boxes flat or in protective cases
- Keep away from humidity and direct sunlight
- Consider box protectors for valuable items
- Battery replacement every 15-20 years for RPGs
- Clean cartridge pins gently with isopropyl alcohol
