3. Late-era releases (1993+)
4. Shooter genre
5. Working CD/hardware
6. Limited print runs

## Condition Grading

### HuCard Grading

| Grade      | Card Condition              | Label  | Value Impact |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Mint       | Perfect, no marks           | Clean  | 100%         |
| Near Mint  | Minimal handling            | Clean  | 90-95%       |
| Excellent  | Light wear, plays perfectly | Minor  | 80-90%       |
| Good       | Visible wear, works fine    | Wear   | 60-75%       |
| Acceptable | Heavy wear, functional      | Damage | 40-50%       |

**Note:** HuCard label damage significantly impacts value due to visibility.

### Case Grading (NA)

| Grade      | Description                         | Impact     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Mint       | Perfect plastic, no cracks          | Full value |
| Near Mint  | Minor shelf wear only               | 90-95%     |

| Good       | Visible wear, small cracks possible | 60-75%     |
| Acceptable | Cracks, yellowing, but complete     | 40-50%     |

**Common Issue:** NA cases use brittle plastic that cracks easily. Check hinge areas.

### CD Grading

| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------- |

| Good       | Moderate scratches, occasional issues | 50-70%     |

## Authentication

### Identifying Counterfeits

TG-16/PCE counterfeits are less common but exist for valuable titles.

**Authentic HuCard Signs:**

1. Proper NEC/Hudson copyright text
2. Correct pin configuration
3. Quality label printing
4. Proper card thickness
5. Correct chip inside (if opened)

**Suspicious Signs:**

1. Blurry or off-color labels
2. Wrong plastic color/texture
3. Label peeling or bubbling
4. Incorrect fonts
5. Missing embossed details

### Reproduction Awareness

**High-Risk Titles:**

- Magical Chase (extremely counterfeited)
- Any sealed rare NA game
- High-value Japanese HuCards
- Late-release titles

**Protection Tips:**

1. Buy from established sellers
2. Request detailed photos
3. Compare to known authentic copies
4. Be skeptical of "too good" deals
5. Use community authentication resources

## The Import Scene

### Why Import?

**Advantages:**

1. **Library Size**: 650+ JP games vs 143 NA
2. **Pricing**: Often 50-75% cheaper
3. **Exclusives**: Many never left Japan
4. **Quality**: Same game, lower price
5. **CD Games**: Region-free anyway

### Import Considerations

**Language Barrier by Genre:**

| Genre       | Playability | Notes                     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Shooters    | ★★★★★       | No reading required       |
| Action      | ★★★★☆       | Minimal text              |
| Platformers | ★★★★★       | Self-explanatory          |
| Puzzle      | ★★★★☆       | Usually intuitive         |
| Fighting    | ★★★★★       | Move lists in manuals     |

| Adventure   | ★☆☆☆☆       | Text-dependent            |

### Import Setup

**Playing Japanese HuCards on TG-16:**

1. **Converter**: HuCard region adapter ($20-40)
2. **Mod**: Pin 29 modification (permanent)
3. **Japanese Console**: Cleanest solution

**Playing NA HuCards on PC Engine:**

1. **Converter**: TurboChip adapter (rarer)

## Storage & Preservation

### Optimal Storage

**Environment:**

- Temperature: 60-70°F (15-21°C)
- Humidity: 30-50%
- Light: Minimal UV exposure
- Dust: Controlled environment

**HuCard Storage:**

- Keep in original cases when possible

### Hardware Preservation

**Capacitor Maintenance:**

Nearly all TG-16/PCE hardware needs capacitor replacement after 30+ years.

**Priority for Recapping:**

1. TurboExpress/GT (most failure-prone)
2. CD-ROM units (audio issues)
3. Base consoles (less critical)

**Professional Recap Cost:**

- TurboExpress: $60-100
- CD units: $40-80
- Base console: $30-50

### Long-Term Storage

**If storing hardware long-term:**

1. Remove any batteries
2. Clean contacts with isopropyl alcohol
3. Store in anti-static bags
4. Include silica gel packets
5. Avoid temperature extremes
6. Check periodically
