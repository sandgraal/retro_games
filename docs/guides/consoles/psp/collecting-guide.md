## Condition Grading

### UMD Disc Grading

| Grade      | Description                                  | Value Impact |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Mint       | No scratches, perfect disc                   | Full value   |
| Near Mint  | Minor surface marks, plays perfectly         | 95%          |
| Excellent  | Light scratches, no read issues              | 85-90%       |
| Good       | Moderate scratches, may have occasional skip | 60-75%       |
| Acceptable | Heavy scratches, works but issues possible   | 40-50%       |
| Poor       | Deep gouges, may not read                    | For parts    |

**Important:** UMD surface is more resilient than standard CDs/DVDs due to protective cartridge, but deep scratches still cause issues.

### Case Grading

| Grade      | Description                          | Value Impact |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Mint       | Perfect case, no cracks or yellowing | Full value   |

| Excellent  | Light wear, slight haze on plastic   | 80-90%       |
| Good       | Visible wear, small cracks possible  | 60-75%       |
| Acceptable | Heavy wear, cracks, but complete     | 40-50%       |
| Poor       | Major damage, missing pieces         | 20-30%       |

**Common Issue:** PSP case hinges crack easily. Check inner hinge area carefully.

### Manual Grading

| Grade      | Description                       | Impact   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | -------- |
| Mint       | Perfect, uncreased, no markings   | +10-15%  |
| Excellent  | Light handling, no damage         | Baseline |
| Good       | Creases, minor edge wear          | -5%      |
| Acceptable | Heavy wear, writing, but complete | -10-15%  |
| Missing    | No manual                         | -15-25%  |

## Authentication

### Identifying Counterfeits

PSP games are occasionally counterfeited, especially for high-value RPGs.

**Legitimate UMD Signs:**

1. Holographic Sony logo on disc
2. Sharp, clear label printing
3. Proper weight and feel
4. Consistent case quality
5. Matching serial numbers
6. Quality manual printing

**Counterfeit Red Flags:**

1. Blurry or offset label printing
2. Wrong disc color tone
3. Missing holographic elements
4. Poor quality case (wrong plastic feel)
5. Manual printing issues
6. Incorrect or missing serial numbers
7. Too-good-to-be-true pricing on rare games

### Reproduction Awareness

**High-Risk Titles (Check Carefully):**

- Class of Heroes 2
- Hexyz Force
- Growlanser: Wayfarer of Time
- Any sealed rare RPG

**Authentication Tips:**

1. Buy from reputable sellers
2. Request multiple photos
3. Compare to known legitimate copies
4. Check eBay seller feedback history
5. Be suspicious of bulk "sealed" rare games

---

## Storage & Preservation

### Optimal Storage Conditions

**Environment:**

- Temperature: 60-70°F (15-21°C)
- Humidity: 30-50%
- Light: Minimal/indirect
- Dust: Controlled (closed storage)

**Storage Position:**

- Stand cases vertically (like books)
- Avoid stacking flat
- Allow air circulation
- Use bookends to prevent leaning

### Long-Term Preservation

**UMD Care:**

1. Keep in cases when not in use
2. Handle by edges only
3. Clean with microfiber (center to edge)
4. Never use harsh chemicals
5. Store away from heat sources

**Console Preservation:**

1. **Remove battery** for long-term storage (prevents swelling/leakage)
2. Store in protective case
3. Include silica packets for moisture control
4. Charge every 6-12 months if keeping battery installed
5. Clean before storage

### Battery Management

**Critical:** PSP batteries degrade and swell over time. Safety considerations:

- Check batteries regularly for swelling
- Replace swollen batteries immediately (fire hazard)
- Official Sony batteries increasingly rare
- Aftermarket options ($10-20) adequate for play
- Store spare batteries at 40-50% charge

## Acquisition Strategies

### Best Purchase Sources

| Source               | Pros                        | Cons                    | Best For          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| eBay                 | Selection, price comparison | Fees, shipping risks    | Specific titles   |
| Local game stores    | Can inspect, no shipping    | Higher prices           | Quality assurance |
| Facebook Marketplace | Deals, bundles              | Risk of issues          | Bulk lots         |
| Retro game stores    | Expertise, guarantees       | Premium pricing         | Rare items        |
| Mercari/OfferUp      | Deals possible              | Variable seller quality | Local pickups     |
| Japanese importers   | Exclusive titles            | Shipping, language      | Imports           |
| Game conventions     | Inspection, deals           | Limited schedule        | Networking        |

### Buying Strategies

**For Common Titles:**

- Shop eBay completed listings for fair prices
- Check local stores first
- Buy in lots when possible
- Greatest Hits versions often adequate

**For Rare Titles:**

- Set up eBay saved searches with alerts
- Check prices across multiple platforms
- Consider Japanese versions (often cheaper)
- Buy when you see fair price (don't wait)

**For Sealed Games:**

- Authenticate carefully before purchase
- Consider Y-fold vs. H-seal differences
- Store appropriately (climate controlled)
- Insure valuable sealed items

### Lot Buying Tips

Large lots often provide best value:

**Evaluate Lots By:**

1. Count games at current market value
2. Assess console condition if included
3. Factor accessory value
4. Calculate shipping costs
5. Consider resale potential of duplicates

**Red Flags in Lots:**

- Heavy sports game padding
- "As-is" console condition
- Missing photos of actual items
- Unrealistic game counts

---

## Budget Collecting

### Maximum Value Approach

For collectors on tight budgets:

**Priority Purchases:**

1. Console (PSP-2000, $60-80)
2. Memory card (8GB+ MicroSD with adapter, $10)
3. Top 10 essentials ($100-150)
4. Expand by genre preference

**Money-Saving Tactics:**

1. **Greatest Hits versions**: Same game, lower price
2. **Japanese imports**: Many work in English, cheaper
3. **Loose discs**: Significantly cheaper if case not priority
4. **Bundle purchases**: Better per-game pricing
5. **Patience**: Wait for deals on non-urgent wants

### Free/Low-Cost Additions

**Legitimate Options:**

- PSN purchases before store closure (games still downloadable if bought)
- Fan translations for Japanese games
- Homebrew games (legal independent releases)

---

## The Import Scene

### Japanese Imports Worth Considering
