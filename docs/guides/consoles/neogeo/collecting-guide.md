## Platform Strategy

### Which Format to Collect?

| Format | Best For                            | Entry Cost | Game Cost   |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |

## Hardware Collecting

### AES Console Acquisition

**Console Variants:**

| Version         | Region | Notes                | Value      |
| --------------- | ------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Original (1990) | Japan  | First revision       | $300-500   |
| Original (1990) | USA    | US market            | $400-600   |
| Later revisions | Any    | Various improvements | $300-500   |
| Gold System     | Japan  | Limited edition      | $800-1,500 |

**What to Verify When Buying:**

1. Cartridge slot condition (wear, bent pins)
2. Controller port functionality
3. Video output quality (RGB preferred)
4. Memory card slot operation
5. Power supply health
6. Cosmetic condition (scratches, yellowing)

### MVS Board Acquisition

**Board Types:**

| Type  | Slots | Best For           | Value    |
| ----- | ----- | ------------------ | -------- |
| MV-1C | 1     | Space-efficient    | $80-150  |
| MV-1F | 1     | Good reliability   | $100-180 |
| MV-2F | 2     | Multi-game setup   | $120-200 |
| MV-4F | 4     | Serious collectors | $200-350 |
| MV-6F | 6     | Ultimate setup     | $300-500 |

**MVS Considerations:**

- Need consolizer or SuperGun for home use
- 1-slot boards are most practical
- 4/6-slot impressive but large
- UniBIOS installation highly recommended

### Neo Geo CD Acquisition

**Model Comparison:**

| Model        | Speed | Reliability | Value    | Recommendation |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Front-loader | 1x    | Moderate    | $150-250 | ★★★☆☆          |
| Top-loader   | 1x    | Better      | $200-300 | ★★★★☆          |
| CDZ          | 2x    | Best        | $300-500 | ★★★★★          |

**CDZ Advantages:**

- Faster loading (still slow by modern standards)
- Japan-only (all games region-free anyway)
- Most reliable CD drive

### Controller Collecting

**Controller Values:**

| Controller              | Condition | Value    |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| AES Joystick (original) | Good      | $80-150  |
| AES Joystick (mint)     | Excellent | $150-250 |
| CD Pad Controller       | Good      | $40-80   |
| Neo Geo Stick 2         | Good      | $100-200 |
| Pro Stick               | Good      | $150-300 |

## Authentication

### Identifying Counterfeits

Neo Geo counterfeits are sophisticated. Check these elements:

**AES Cartridge Authentication:**

1. **Label Quality**: Authentic labels have specific printing characteristics
2. **Cart Shell**: Correct color, texture, and mold marks
3. **PCB**: Proper board revision, SNK markings
4. **Security Chip**: PRO-CT0 or equivalent present
5. **Weight**: Authentic carts have consistent weight
6. **Sound**: Audio quality, hiss patterns

**Red Flags:**

- Wrong font on labels
- Incorrect board revision for game
- Missing or wrong security chip
- Label bubbling or peeling
- Wrong shell color
- Spelling errors
- PCB color variations

### High-Risk Titles

These games are frequently counterfeited:

| Title            | Risk Level | Why Targeted             |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Kizuna Encounter | Extreme    | Highest AES value        |
| Matrimelee       | Extreme    | Late-era rarity          |
| Metal Slug 3     | High       | Popular + expensive      |
| Garou: MOTW      | High       | Beloved + expensive      |
| Last Blade 2     | High       | Late-era + beautiful     |
| All sealed AES   | Extreme    | Impossible to verify PCB |

### Protection Strategies

1. **Buy from established sellers** with return policies
2. **Request detailed photos** of label, PCB, box
3. **Compare to known authentic** examples online
4. **Use community resources** for verification
5. **If it seems too good** to be true, it is
6. **Document purchases** for future reference

---

## Storage & Preservation

### Optimal Storage Conditions

**Environment:**

- Temperature: 60-70°F (15-21°C)
- Humidity: 30-50%
- Light: Minimal (UV damages labels)
- Dust: Controlled environment

### AES Cartridge Storage

**Best Practices:**

1. Keep in shockboxes (prevents damage)
2. Store vertically (like books)
3. Replace degrading foam inserts
4. Use protective cases for valuable items
5. Clean contacts periodically

### Hardware Preservation

**Console Care:**

1. Cover when not in use (dust prevention)
2. Use surge protection
3. Keep in climate-controlled space
4. Clean cartridge slot carefully
5. Test periodically

**Battery Backup (MVS):**

- All MVS boards have backup batteries
- Replace every 5-10 years proactively
- Dead battery = lost settings
- Easy replacement (CR2032 typically)

## Budget Collecting

### Maximum Value Approach

For tight budgets, prioritize experience over prestige:

**Ultra-Budget ($500):**

1. Neo Geo CD top-loader ($150-250)
2. CD controller ($40-60)
3. 8-10 CD games ($200-300)

**MVS Route ($800):**

1. Consolized MVS or SuperGun ($200-400)
2. 1-slot MVS board ($80-150)
3. 10+ MVS carts ($300-500)

**Hybrid Strategy ($1,500):**

1. MVS setup for gameplay ($400)
2. 15 MVS games ($500)
3. Select AES for display ($600)

### Cost-Saving Tactics

1. **Start MVS**: Same games, 90% savings
2. **Japanese CD games**: Often cheaper
3. **Loose MVS carts**: Save on boxes
4. **Flash cart**: NeoSD for library access
5. **Be patient**: Prices fluctuate
