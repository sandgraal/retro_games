# Collecting for Xbox 360: The Complete Guide

_Last updated: December 2025_

## Introduction

The Xbox 360 defined the HD gaming era. Microsoft's second console beat competitors to market, pioneered achievements and online gaming, and built a library that mixed Western blockbusters with surprising JRPG gems. For collectors, the 360 offers incredible value with prices at historic lows for most titles.

**Why Collect for Xbox 360?**

- Massive library (2,000+ games)
- Rock-bottom prices for most titles
- Best versions of many multiplatform games
- Surprising JRPG exclusives
- Achievement hunting culture
- Excellent backwards compatibility on modern Xbox

**Current Market Position:** Xbox 360 games are at their most affordable ever. Common titles are $3-10, and even sought-after games rarely exceed $40-50. This won't last forever—collecting now is smart.

| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Triple Pack (XBLA Hits) | Various XBLA games |
| Sega Vintage Collection | Classic SEGA games |
| XBLA Compilation discs  | Regional releases  |
| Pinball FX compilations | Multiple tables    |
