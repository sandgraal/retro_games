## Getting Started

### Entry-Level Budget: $100-$200

For newcomers, focus on:

1. **Console (RVL-001 preferred)** - ($40-$70) for GameCube BC
2. **Wii Remote + Nunchuk** - ($20-$35)
3. **Sensor Bar** - ($5-$10 or included)
4. **5-8 starter games** - Focus on first-party Nintendo

**Recommended Starter Set:**

- Super Mario Galaxy ($18-$30)
- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess ($18-$30)
- Mario Kart Wii ($25-$45)
- Wii Sports + Wii Sports Resort ($20-$40 together)
- New Super Mario Bros. Wii ($18-$32)
- Metroid Prime 3: Corruption ($15-$25)

**Total Investment:** ~$150-$280 for a solid foundation

### Why Choose RVL-001?

The original Wii model (RVL-001) is strongly preferred:

✅ GameCube backward compatibility
✅ GameCube controller ports (4)
✅ GameCube memory card slots

✅ Component video support

Later models removed GameCube support, making RVL-001 the collector's choice.

Core first-party games that define the platform.

**Phase 2: Hidden Gems ($350-$700)**
