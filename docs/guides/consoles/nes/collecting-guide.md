# Collecting for NES: The Complete Guide

_Last updated: December 2025_

## Introduction

The Nintendo Entertainment System saved the video game industry from collapse and established Nintendo as a household name. Collecting for NES means connecting with the roots of modern gaming—from Super Mario Bros. to The Legend of Zelda, these are the games that defined what video games could be.

For collectors, the NES presents unique opportunities and challenges: a massive library of 700+ licensed titles (plus hundreds of unlicensed), a range of cartridge variants, and some of the most iconic games ever made. Whether you're seeking affordable classics or hunting ultra-rare stadium events, the NES has something for every collector.

**Current Market Position**: Established collector's market with stable prices. Common games are affordable ($5-20), first-party essentials moderately priced ($20-50), and rare titles can reach thousands.
