QUICK AGENT HANDOFF PROMPT (Copy-Paste This)
=============================================

Review project status in docs/AGENT_QUICKSTART.md and docs/implementation-plan.md (Phase 0 section). 

Pick the next highest-priority unchecked task (Phase 0 refactoring is CRITICAL). 

Work autonomously making minimal changes, testing frequently (npm run lint && npm test). 

Stop when you hit a decision point, blocker, or complete 4 hours of work. 

Create PR with:
1. What changed (bullet list)
2. Progress update (roadmap checkboxes)  
3. Why you stopped & what intervention is needed
4. Instructions for next agent

Follow feature freeze: NO new features, only Phase 0 refactoring and critical bug fixes. 

Ensure all tests pass and docs updated before PR.

See .github/AGENT_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md for detailed instructions.
